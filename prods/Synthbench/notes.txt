    changed widgets so they apply the transform to opengl
    checked that there are no issues with an error being caused
    while modelview stack unbalanced
    
    Added __index to vector metatable so that calling code can look
    like this:
    
    slider.mousePos:set(x,y,z)
    
    instead of this:
    
    Vector3D.set(slider.mousePos, x,y,z)
    
    Should do the same for transform.
    
    Should also set working folder to prods so that any of the prods can
    be opened from a praxis session, and common code can stay in the root
    
    Added f4 key event to cognitive for adding a second slider to further
    play with new widget facility
    
    Using drawText3DStroked from Slider.render to show text drawn
    in local coordinate space.
